I enjoy long cycling journey to watch the landscape as well as collecting stories. In the past, it's super proud to me that I have done two long cycling journey with my patners, which two are 1). Wuhan, Hubei -> Changsha, Hunan, 400km 2). Cycling Qinghai Lake, Qinghai, 400km. 

I'm always planning to unlock more interesting cycling journey. If you want to be with me, let's explore together.
