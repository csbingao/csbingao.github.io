I enjoy long cycling journeys to watch the landscape as well as collecting stories. In the past, it's super proud to me that I have done two long cycling journeys with my partners, which two are 1). Wuhan, Hubei -> Changsha, Hunan, 400km 2). Cycling Qinghai Lake, Qinghai, 400km.

I'm always planning to unlock more interesting cycling journeys. If you want to be with me, let's explore together.
